## uSANMA ROS2 and uROS SYSTEMS
This project is based on ROS 2 framework with the goal to create an autonomous system to accomplish maintenance and management on agropecural fields. The complexity of this project comes with the fact that the robot must be able to navigate through tough terrain using the navigation 2 framework that is 100% autonomous and implemented alongside uROS for the robot's hardware system framework. 

We also aim to accomplish a self charging capability for the robot with a docking station. Additionally, after the prototype version is developed, the final version of robot must be able to carry at least 30L of load. At first this load may be just water for irrigating but at this stage, implementing a depth capable camera onto the system to detect pests and then shoot some kind of pesticide onto it, would be feasible.
